This is the current version of the S country, OLG model. The following are the files:

1: Central File
    -To run the entire file, this is the starting point. It's intended to be simple enough
     so those who are only interested in running the model and getting results, they can
     change the parameters here.
2: Optimization
    -This is where the computations are done. For those who want to change the workings of
     the model, this is the folder to look in.
3: Demographics
    -The data files are processed in this file and its data is used in the optimization file
     The Data_Files folder has all of the population data that is used.
4: Functions
    -This is where the individual functions are stored. This is section will relate to the
     paper's equation section

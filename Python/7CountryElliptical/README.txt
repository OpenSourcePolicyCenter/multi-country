This version is a temporary off-shoot of 7CountryAlphaV3. In this version
an elliptical utility function is used. I focused on getting the new solution
method to work without putting in the skill classes in 7CountryAlphaV3. Also,
I used polynomial fitting give better demographics data.

Data_Files: This folder contains the data files from Kotlikoff's research.
            They include the fertility and mortality rates for each country 
            over time. Net migration and population are included as well.

FertilityGraphs: Folder that contains the Fertility Rate fits calculated by
                 OLS.

Graphs: Folder that contains the graphs of the output of the overall code.

ImmigrationGraphs: Similar to FertilityGraphs, but for Immigration Rates.

MortalityGraphs: Similar to FertilityGraphs, but for Mortality Rates.

STATA_Files: This is where the code outputs the .CSV files that contain the
             coefficients dependent variables for immigration, mortality and 
             fertility. There is also a .do file that can be run in STATA that 
             will run the regressions and get the details about each of the 
             polynomial fits.

Main.py- The central file where the user can change their inputs. By running
         this script, the whole model will run.

oldHHsolver.py- Not currently used, but it was a pre-vectorized version of
                the TPI calculation.

pure_cython_setup_distutils.py- Also, not currently used, but sets up a cython
                                version of the most time-intensive part of TPI.
                                Marginally speeds up the code.

pure_cython.c- C code generated by distutils in connection with the setup file
               listed above.

pure_cython.pyx- The cython verion of the code that is being sped up.

RobustChecker.py- MPI script that tests the model. It goes through different
                  combinations of numbers of countries, number of cohorts
                  and sigma levels. It outputs .CSV files that will indicate
                  if that particular combination converged.

StepbyStepv1.py- This file is where the calculations occur. It's broken
                 down into steady state and TPI sections. Examine the
                 file for more details. Note thate demographics are NOT
                 incorporated, but they are coded up.

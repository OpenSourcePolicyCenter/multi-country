============================
OSPC Multi-Country Tax Model
============================

This repository includes the data used to calibrate the model along with all the necessary Python code to solve and simulate.

The Model
=========
This project builds, calibrates and simulates the effects of changes in various taxes on multiple economies in the context of a dynamic overlapping generations general equilibrium model.  This project builds on the work of Fehr et al. (2008), Fehr et al. (2011), Fehr et al. (2013) and Benzell et al. (2015).  Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University has been a major contributor to those papers and to this project.

Disclaimer
==========
The model is currently under development. Users should be forewarned that the model componenents could change significantly. Therefore, there is NO GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY. THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you should assume the calculations are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture and have checked the results against other existing implementations of the tax code. The package will have released versions, which will be checked against existing code prior to release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!
